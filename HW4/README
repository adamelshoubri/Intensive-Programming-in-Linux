https://web.njit.edu/~yurkowsk/29sept/competitorA

and

https://web.njit.edu/~yurkowsk/29sept/competitorB

These files contain 3 comma separated fields:

customer,sales,product

where sales in a number and customer and product are strings.

Find any customers that appear in both files that have total sales of more than 100000 and print the customer name and products they purchased.

Sample output:


./analysis  https://web.njit.edu/~yurkowsk/29sept/competitorA https://web.njit.edu/~yurkowsk/29sept/competitorB

customerA buys  routers and switches

customerF buys  servers

customerG buys  routers
