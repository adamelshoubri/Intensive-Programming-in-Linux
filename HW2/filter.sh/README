Write a Bash script, filter.sh, which prints those files/directories that have the size greater than the average file size 
of the directory passed as its first argument .   Suppose for example that the directory /my/dir has 
five files/directories with size in parentheses : a (100) b (10) c (100) d (100) e (20), your program "filter.sh /my/dir" 
will list "a c d" since the size of each of these 3 files  is greater than the average file size of 66.  
Hint: you can use 3 functions to do this: main, average, and filter, where main calls average and filter, 
and average computes the average file size of a directory and filter filters out those that have less than the average.
