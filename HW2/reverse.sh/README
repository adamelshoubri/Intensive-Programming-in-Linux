Write a Bash script, reverse.sh, which reverses the contents of a directory passed as a parameter.   
For example, assuming /my/dir contains cache cron games lib log run tmp, your program "reverse.sh /my/dir" 
will return "tmp run log lib games cron cache." Hint: use an array and two functions: main() and reverse(). 
Do not use the built-in command sort -r.
