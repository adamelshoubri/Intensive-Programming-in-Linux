•Write a Bash script, insert-sort.sh, which sorts a list of command line parameters in ascending order. 
For example, your command will look something like: 
$ insert-sort.sh 7 2 3 9 -1 and type enter.
Your program will return: -1 2 3 7 9
•Use only basic commands and array. Do not use any built-in commands that sort array.
