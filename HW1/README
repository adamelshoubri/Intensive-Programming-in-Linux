Write a Bash script, count.sh, which builds a table of counts for the commands under /bin which start with each letter.  
For example, if there are 3 commands starting with "a" (alsaumute, arch & awk) while there  may be  2 commands starting with "z" 
(zcat & zsh).  The first and last lines your script will print would be:

a 3

...

...

...

z 2

Hint: use loop and array to design and implement this script.
